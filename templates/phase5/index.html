				<h3>[Question] What is the proposed action?</h3>
				
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						The proposal is for the State College Borough government to implement an annual automatic inflation-based property tax increase. The Borough expects its annual costs of operation to increase by at least the rate of inflation, just as every consumer and business experience price increases. The index used to compute the annual property tax increase would be based on the <u>Municipal Cost Index (MCI)</u>, a measure of the increase in the cost of goods and services typically procured by municipalities.

				<h3>[Question] What are the fundamental challenges that the proposed action is trying to address?</h3>
				
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						The State College Borough is challenged to raise sufficient tax revenue to adequately fund the services and infrastructure that are a key to the high quality of life that its citizens enjoy. The <u>Borough’s sources of tax revenue are decreasing</u> at the same time that its <u>expenses are increasing</u>, forcing the Borough to operate at a <u>budget deficit</u>.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						<u>The real estate tax</u> is the primary and most reliable source of <u>Borough revenue</u>;  however, the income generated by this tax is static unless the Borough can grow its <u>assessed-property tax base</u>. The Borough is landlocked by the <u>surrounding townships</u>, and there is <u>very little vacant land in the Borough</u> that can be developed. The generation of more property taxes through higher tax rates is one of the Borough’s few options to increase revenue.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						A critical component of the <u>Borough’s quality of life</u> is <u>public safety</u> and security, which depends on the adequate support of police services. Demands for increased policing and safety ordinances are due to factors such as the growth in the number of Penn State students, new high density housing, and expanded regional tourism. <u>Public safety and security are already being impacted</u>. Funding shortfalls have forced the Borough to cut police officers and to leave staff positions for ordinance enforcement unfilled. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						The Borough’s infrastructure requires constant maintenance and modernization as it ages. For example, the Borough has old water and sewer systems that need to be kept in working order. Streets and trees also require maintenance.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						<u>Personnel costs</u> are a major element of the <u>Borough’s budget</u>; nearly 80% of the Borough’s costs are due to salaries and benefits. Although salaries have stayed relatively constant for the past ten years, the cost of the <u>Borough’s contributions to employees’ health insurance has increased an average of nearly 10% per year</u>.  The <u>Borough’s pension contributions</u> also have increased dramatically. This rate of increase of the Borough’s employees’ benefits is not sustainable without commensurate increases in the Borough’s budget.
					</p>

				<h3>[Question] What are the alternative measures (other than “increase of property taxes in-line with inflation”) to address the challenges identified in [F2] and why are those alternatives excluded from consideration?</h3>
				
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						<u>Demographic trends</u> suggest that more families and affluent residents of the Centre Region are choosing to live outside the Borough and are being replaced by a greater proportion of students. This means that the <u>Earned Income Tax</u>, already a small portion of the Borough’s revenue remains constant or is decreasing. Income from <u>real estate transfer taxes</u>, already an unreliable source of revenue, is also negatively affected.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						Property taxes are based on <u>real estate assessments</u>. Centre County has not updated real estate assessments since 1995. Assessments do not change when properties are bought or sold. The assessments for new developments are rolled back to 1995 values.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						Authority to levy additional taxes and fees can only be granted by the state legislature. Lobbying the Commonwealth should continue, but prospects for success are unknown. Past efforts to seek such authority have been unsuccessful.

				<h3>[Question] What are the intended and unintended consequences that will stem from an automatic, inflationary property tax increase?</h3>
				
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						The intended consequence would be a more predictable funding stream to support services that Borough residents value such as police protection, utility maintenance, and other contributors to quality of life. An unintended consequence would be a lessening of pressure on the Borough Council to budget prudently. Another unintended consequence might be an increase in the number of people who think that the cost of living in the Borough is too high.

				<h3>[Question] What are the intended and unintended consequences that will stem from an automatic, inflationary property tax increase?</h3>
				
				<!-- 1 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						Increased revenue would permit the Borough to fill positions currently unfunded (e.g., police) and provide funding for other needed projects, such as deferred maintenance. Without regular growth in revenue, the Borough would need to reduce the quantity and/or quality of the services it provides to the residents.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- 2 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						Deferred maintenance, unless it is regularly and systematically managed with sufficient funding, will only become more expensive in the future.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- 3 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						Smooth or consistent increases in property taxes would benefit taxpayers, both individuals and businesses, who would know what to expect, as compared to occasional large property tax increases. Recently, <u>property tax levels have been increased</u>, but in an inconsistent and reactive way. In 2014, property tax rates were increased 30%, and in 2015, the property tax rates were increased 14%.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- 4 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						Continuation of the <u>high quality of the Borough’s services</u> requires effective planning and management. To do this, the Borough needs to have predictable future revenue streams. In addition, an inability to appropriately raise employees’ salaries could lead to increasing problems in attracting and retaining quality personnel to provide planning, oversight, and support services.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- 5 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						<u>Natural revenue growth</u> does not occur in the Borough because there is a lack of property that can be developed. Since <u>assessment values</u> remain stagnant unless new development or expansion occurs the only way to increase the aggregate Real Estate Tax revenue is by increasing the tax rate.

				<h3>[Question] What are the major arguments for opposing the proposed action?</h3>
				
				<!-- 1 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						Continuous property tax increases make the borough less attractive to homeowners and businesses. If we are trying to increase homeownership and an attractive business climate, continuous property tax increases are counterproductive.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- 2 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						It is difficult to implement a property tax increase in a fair and equitable way. Homeowners and commercial property owners must pay property taxes themselves. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- 3 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						However, many landlords are able to pass along property tax increases to their tenants.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- 4 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						There is the potential of losing <u>long-term residents</u> whose fixed incomes cannot support such increases.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- 5 -->
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>
						Some citizens will protest automatic tax increases and advocate for annual review of expenses and needs prior to determining if, and by how much, taxes should be increased.
