<p>Subject Matter Expert: Neutral<br />
<br />
Interviewer: This is the neutral subject matter expert’s video. Can we start out with you introducing yourself?<br />
<br />
SME: Hi, I’m Ed LeClear, I’m the community planning director for the Burrow of State College<br />
<br />
Interviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about the history of this ordinance and how it came to be?<br />
<br />
SME: It comes from a 2013, downtown master plan that the council adopted, planning staff, and steering committee worked on for quite some time. Really started laying out avision for revitalizing downtown and looking at how we grow, redevelop, and build on the character that we already have downtown. And so what came out of that was a look at what the master plan consultants laid out, kind of like a collegiate district. And that being East College Avenue, that being adjacent to campus. So, what you saw in 2013 was the property owners starting to look at the master plan and say well can I really redevelop my property in a way that achieves a vision coming into plan and was evident that when you look at the zoning your really couldn’t meet the purpose and the intent of the plan and in some cases even close, by some standards in what was already in place from a zoning standpoint. Our zoning ordinance was written in 1959. It has had over 210 ordinance changes since then. There have been amendments, but it hasn’t been looked at in a comprehensive way since the 50s. So, what’s happened is we kind of have a set of zoning laws for development that are antiquated and are really sort of envisioning a different kind of development, much more from the 60s and 70s in some cases. So, what you see for redevelopment is trying to find a balance of, well how do we try to have the vision of this plan start to play out and realize that the rules that a property owner would be under to try to develop the property don’t match up with that vision. So, that really came out of a property owner at the Kildare’s site. Looking at well how would I redevelop the site, it’s only a one-story property right now and realizing under the current zoning they would really be maxed out at probably 7 stories of primarily residential development. And, in this market, that tends to be student housing for undergraduates, typically. So, the property under brought in amendment to Council in the spring, to suggest, hey I’m looking at how the ordinance could be adjusted. And then, in July, Planning Commissions started working on looking at what was presented by the property owner and has really sort of been waying on the community input, input from Planning Commission, from staff, on that proposal and trying to balance the master plan and in just what we’ve heard from input and sort of balancing a number of objectives for that rezoning. <br />
<br />
Interviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about the purpose of this ordinance and what you hope that it will achieve?<br />
<br />
SME: I think the primary objectives have been the balance, what we typically see in the market as far as student housing and other needs. Other needs being how doe we get professional housing for folks who graduated but want to stay in the community. We often see that market segment squeezed out because there’s such a strong, heavy demand for undergraduate housing. We often don’t see in some cases space in the market for that kind of housing product. Secondly, there’s a desire to give more commercial space not only downtown, but on the first floor, to active the street, so to get more pedestrian uses, glass so that people can see into the first floor, and to make it a more active, walkable downtown. We have a lot of that throughout the heart of downtown, but as you get out to the edges, especially the eastern part of downtown, you don’t see as much pedestrian activity on the first floor and commercial space on the first floor. So, part of the purpose of the ordinance was to require that commercial space and incentivize additional commercial space that is in addition to residential that could already be billed.&nbsp;So, you think about it, the property owner could build 7 floors of student housing today, and I think the Planning Commission staff have been looking at is how do we get more than just that student housing. The other objectives have been how do you get parking handled in a way that isn’t just a surface lot because that’s really not the best use of our land. We are really limited in our ability to develop and so looking at incentivizing, going underground for parking or structured above ground parking that gets off the surface lot. And then other major purposes was to look at how you could incentivize green development in the building itself. What we typically call lead certification to get a better building design, build a better functioning building, that’s more sustainable and that’s expensive. So unless there’s a way to incentivize that a property owner typically won’t do it. Other goals is to get a well-built building that is attractive and people like. So, as we’ll talk about the structure of the ordinance, we’ve tried to incentivize that to make sure that it’s built at a high quality material like glass, etc. And then finally, really making sure that the residential space isn’t necessarily just undergraduate. And so, in some cases, we’re growing this new territory here as far as our zoning ordinance goes and looking at how we might require some of the residential space to be offered for graduate or professional housing. So we were actually exploring a regulatory way of trying to encourage that to happen.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Interviewer: Can you tell me more about the specifics of the ordinance?<br />
<br />
SME: So it’s structured in 3 parts. And for someone taking a look at an ordinance for the first time that might seem a little clumsy as far as why do we have to do it that way and it’s really aimed at trying to incentivize certain things like below ground or above ground parking structured parking, the commercial space, etc. But, realizing that just requiring it may not actually get that kind of development built and that’s going to sound odd but right now if a property owner could build 7 stories of just student housing, why would they build more if they don’t believe that the risk is worth the reward. And so what you’re really trying to find is the balance between getting more than just student housing, but also making sure that the property owner is willing to take the risk and they believe they can get enough return on the investment to make it worth it. So, what we’re always trying to find is a balance, I think commission spent a lot of time on that. This has been a 9 month process. Try to find that spot where we’re getting more than what we know the market will easily do with student housing but not require or force so much that the property owner simply walks away and says well I’ll just build the 7 stories of student housing and I’m not going to do any of this other stuff. The ordinance is structured to try to build more value for the property owner but that value comes from non-undergraduate student housing.&nbsp;So the first part of the ordinance is to really try to modernize the basic CDA striker of the commercial district. That district has not had much change since the 50s. I mean it’s had some minor modifications but of all of our downtown zoning districts, it’s probably the one that has seen the least change and has the most sort of 1950s or 70s era. In that district, you’re capped at 65 feet for maximum height and there’s really no commercial requirement and for commercial space we tend to find we want higher ceilings. So we looked at how do we make sure that we’re not penalizing a property for having more modern, higher ceiling space. So, we increased the maximum height, but at the same time required a first floor commercial space. Which, we really don’t do anywhere else in the ordinance. So, we’re kind of looking at how do we start requiring some personal or commercial again to activate the street. We also then try to make sure that since we’re not requiring a commercial space, there’s going to be a lot more of a Floor Area Ration (FAR). This is how much you can build the building out on a lot. What we also found, especially out in that part of town is that we tend to have smaller, skinnier buildings that are taller. Part of that has to do with how the FAR is calculated in our ordinance. So, you’ll probably hear some discussion of that as we go thought this process as far as, well we’ve adjusted the FAR, and that’s really about how do we expand the building on a lot, so that it’s not just a tall, skinny building. The second part of the ordinance is a table of incentives. Things that basically say to the property owner, if you want some additional height or some additional FAR then you need to do&nbsp;XYZ. And those things are things that I think we’ve all come to some consensus are benefits to the community, whether they be more commercial square footage, whether they be underground parking, some incentives on parking reduction related to bikes and trying to get more space for bike parking,&nbsp;etc. And that lead certification to make it worthwhile to do that. So, what we have done as part of the process, is ensure that they have to take advantages of some of those incentives and then we go to the third part of the ordinance and that’s a conditional-use process and I guess to give the quick 30 seconds on conditional use, that is a process you go through where council says this is something, this is a use that is permitted, but in order to do it, we as a governing body are putting some additional conditions on it. In this case it tends to be focused on design and using certain materials in the construction. From a zoning standpoint, it’s not something that can be acquired, it’s something that we really have to incentivize. So by getting to that third part of the ordinance, we’re looking at some minimal design criteria and so we start exploring reductions of the amount of beds that can be in a unit, trying to mix up so it’s not a one unit with 4 beds or with 4 bedrooms, in some cases you’ll have multiple beds in the bedroom. So we’re trying to make the product type itself, not as we’re just cramming lots of students into small floors, which is kin of what we have in some buildings in the borough today. Again based on an ordinance that’s pretty old. So, the other advantage in that conditional use is that we started exploring a way to require that some of the floors and housing be for professional graduate students, not undergraduate. The basics of that is putting covenant on the deed that restricts that kind of use and we’ve explored methods of how it might enforce that with the borough and this is kind of a new thing, something that we’ve heard from Council, Planning Commission, from public, that we wanted to explore and see how it might make reality and this is kind of the first time we were doing something like this in the borough. And then finally, there’s also some requirements in there for some public space for community use in the building. So, that was additional piece that was added on as pert of the commission.<br />
<br />
Interviewer: Great, is there anything else you’d like to add?<br />
<br />
SME: Well just that, One of the planning commission members, while we were going through this, we discussed the geographic area, in fact that we we’re looking at just one block and we discussed this as being a conservative improvement approach to not trying to make a lot of changes for a lot of downtown all at once, and instead look at how to explore some of these things, like the professional graduate housing and do it in a fairly small area. So, one of the issues about this overlay is really only one block. The original proposal for two blocks, it was both the 600 and the 500 block of downtown, but based on public input and the planning commission desire, we shrunk that down to 5 or just the 500 block. And I think that part of the reason for that is there are some things in this ordinance that are trying to explore other ideas, like how do we get residential housing right next to downtown that isn’t students, or undergraduate students. So, that exploration is something that we kind of want to do in a relatively confined space. So, we didn’t want to make a big change for all of the C district for instance. And then be looking at this kind of height or this kind of development all through downtown is C basically goes through most of the East College corridor, all the way down I think to almost to where five guys is. So, that’s something else that I think participants should think about as far as why it’s only one block.<br />
<br />
Interviewer: Great. Thank you very much for your time.<br />
<br />
SME: Thank you</p>

<p>Subject Matter Expert: Substantiate<br />
<br />
<strong>This recording is of the substantiate subject matter expert's position statement. And, first I'm going to start out by asking you to introduce yourself.</strong><br />
<br />
Sure, my name is D.J Liggett. I'm a senior planner with the Centre Regional Planning Agency.<br />
<br />
<strong>Great, and could you start out by telling us a little bit about some of the background materials that you used to familiarize yourself with this issue.</strong><br />
<br />
Absolutely, for me this issue goes back quite a ways to the overall regional comprehensive plan that was done by all of the center region municipalities. It was initiated back in about 2010 and it was completed in 2013, and that comprehensive plan looked at the community holistically and identified growth boundary areas and preservation areas, and that led to a future land-use map for the region. The future land-use map identifies what kinds of land uses you want to see and where those land uses would be. In the Borough of State College, for obvious reasons, because it's an employment center, because the university is there, because there is a pour-down of town there, the Borough is identified as a higher density land-use area. Out of that future land-use map, and with other planning initiatives in the Borough, the Borough began a downtown master plan process, looking at what can be done in the downtown area.<br />
<br />
One of the suggestions that came out of that downtown master plan had to do with the east end of the downtown of the Borough, and identified specifically what they called an "east-end collegiate district". So the ordinance that has been developed by the Borough Planning Commission at this point mirrors a lot of the recommendations that came out of that downtown master plan. So if you consider the premise that higher density development makes sense in the Borough of State College, and you try to incentivize how you get that higher density development to occur, you start looking at an ordinance that will provide some trade-offs to a developer who may find development in the Borough of State College a little bit more expensive. Land is a little higher priced, the infrastructure is already in place, so you're not paying for those sorts of things, but you're paying for that cost of the land. So ordinances in the development of the Borough may tend to be a little more expensive and little more difficult for developers.<br />
<br />
One way to encourage developers to build in the Borough would be to allow them to increase density, and, as I said, the Borough is an area that has been identified as appropriate for higher-density, for a variety of reasons that I mentioned as well- the proximity to the university, the proximity to employment. So the ordinance that is under consideration right now, the Collegiate Overlay District Ordinance- it identifies as an incentive or as a bonus to the developers, the ability to increase residential density. And it's described in terms of FAR, which is a difficult concept for people to understand, but FAR basically represents floor-area ratio. And when they say they're increasing FAR from three (3) to four (4), essentially what that means is the floor-area ratio for your building is 1000 sq. ft. A FAR of three (3) means that you can have 3000 sq. ft. of residential development. If you increase that to four (4) now you can have 4000 sq. ft. of residential development. So as you increase that number, you're increasing actually as stories of a building- you add another story of residential development; it's kind of like that concept.<br />
<br />
So the carrot for developers to develop in the Borough would be to allow them to build higher residential density. That’s attractive to the Borough because there are a lot of student housing projects in the Borough already, there are a lot of students living in the Borough. Some of them are scattered in Borough neighborhoods living in rental conversion properties as opposed to being closer to the downtown or in campus. So identifying the east end as a location for higher student housing makes a lot of sense because it's directly across the street from Penn State University. There are a lot of student housing projects in that area already, and so this is an area that was targeted for higher residential development and specifically geared toward students. <br />
<br />
The density incentive is then offset by the things that the community values in terms of this development. Some of the things that the Borough has identified in the way of community values are first floor commercial use. So in this ordinance you're required to put in first floor commercial. That's a benefit because it enhances the walkability of the downtown, it provides for amenities that are within walking or bicycling distance.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A further benefit of having more walkability is you're finite resources that are devoted to the public transit system can now be offered to Houserville or places like Boalsburg instead of providing intense transit service to some of these student housing projects that are located outside of easy walking distance. You can provide them to folks so that they can find an affordable place to live; a single family house and an affordable place to live. So you're spreading your transit services a little more generally around the community as opposed to providing intense level of transit service to one student housing unit, so student housing in the Borough enables bicycling and walking.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another community value that's incorporated into the ordinance is reduction of parking. A surface parking lot is not as attractive to walk past as a commercial development or something that has some appeal to pedestrians walking by. And a surface parking is not going to provide the same kind of tax revenues to the Borough as a higher-rise building will provide there. So by allowing a reduction in parking, increasing the amount of bicycling parking that's provided as part of the building- that's another benefit that the Borough will gather from offering the incentive of higher residential development.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The other incentive or trade-off that the Borough is requesting as a result of higher density development is higher attention to the building materials and in the buildings that are being built. So requirements for Lead certification or green-building design are incorporated into this ordinance. The outdoor building materials and the presence of the building on the street has to be of higher level in order to make it an attractive facility. So all of those community values are then provided in exchange for the developer getting a higher amount of residential development. Another provision in the ordinance, at this point, is to encourage a variety of housing types within the building so that it's all not devoted to student housing, there might be some young professional housing, there might be some graduate student housing in the building as well- so there are incentives built into the ordinance to encourage developers to address that particular need for housing in the downtown as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So in a nutshell, as I said, if you believe that it's important to concentrate higher density development within the core area of the community, which I would identify as the Borough of State College, if you recognize that the development within the Borough is perhaps more expensive or more difficult for developers, then you can understand that it makes sense to offer developers an incentive in the way of a residential density bonus, where, again, it makes sense to have residential density. And then in exchange for that, request that the developer provide things like onsite bicycle parking, first floor commercial uses, a building that's Lead certified or a green building, and other amenities that will be helpful to the community in that location downtown.<br />
<br />
<strong>Thank you. Is there anything else about your position on this issue that you'd like to share?</strong><br />
<br />
No I think that sums it up.<br />
<br />
<strong>Excellent, well thank you very much for your time.</strong><br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>So I just wanted to follow up and ask for clarification that you may have been willing to change your position on this had the ordinance been different. Can you tell me a little bit about what it would take for you to substantiate this ordinance?</strong><br />
<br />
Sure. My writing in general is always about the equation and the variables and the measurable goals. My position on this could change if there was an equation, definition of variables, and measurable outcomes that came out of those. The first topic mentioned was "serving the community greater good". I'm not sure what that means. If it was defined in a manner that I agreed with, that would be a reason to support the ordinance in that manner. If it were defined that to extrapolate on that to say safety- was safety one of those things that served a greater good, safety has measurable restrictions to it. You know you can calm traffic with signals. You can widen roadways with bike paths. You can do the things necessary in support of this with measurable outcomes that currently aren't in the ordinance, but if written into the ordinance would say that serves this purpose. The same down the other examples that I said, but that would be the thing that could tip one way or the other on a writing and an opinion on the matter.<br />
<br />
<strong>Okay, thanks for sharing that.</strong><br />
<br />
You're welcome.</p>

<strong>So this is the Subject matter expert interview for the refute statement. Hi, can you just start out by introducing yourself?</strong><br />
<br />
Sure Jess, my name is Al Pringle and I'm president of the Keystone Real Estate Group in State College. I've been here for about 20 years, actually, 20 years last year, so almost 21 in State College. My background is, I have a civil engineering degree from Bucknell University and an MBA from Pitt. Nobody likes Pitt, we all like Penn State. And, I've been in this position in the development business for that full 20 years while I've been here in State College. <br />
<br />
<strong>Okay, can you tell me how you came to learn about this issue and how you informed your opinion about it?</strong><br />
<br />
Sure, Meagan Tuttle had contacted us probably 6 or 8 months ago just for a general introduction session when she was coming to town and getting organized, we met her at that point and then as this process came through her office, she had remembered her discussions with us and reached out to me as a potential expert witness in the process.<br />
<br />
<strong>Okay, and could you give us your position on this ordinance?&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
Sure, when Meagan reached out she had sent to me the instructions, the purpose of the ordinance, a little background work, and then the ordinance itself as well, and asked for a simple writing of do you believe whether or not this ordinance had met the purpose that it intended to create, and so that was my reading and writing from it. So I'll start by saying this, I ended in the negative to say that I don't believe it met the intended purpose. And I'll just touch on a few bullet points as to why I thought that was.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
First and foremost, we discussed a moment ago, but I'm an engineer and I love equations. Equations say to me these variables create a result and in this case I thought the variables weren't clearly defined in the result wasn't clearly defined and the purpose itself. For example, the purpose said in the first paragraph, first sentence, it was intended to achieve the greater community good. I'm not sure what that means, a greater community good means a lot of different things to a lot of different interests and interest groups, and I couldn't define that. In my writing I said a greater community good could mean things like does it have public safety, is it protecting property values, or does it generally organize the utilization of land? Those are things that could be conceived as greater community good. Not defined in the ordinance but my own definitions. From there I described this as to how I felt about the ordinance in its current draft format, did not meet current public safety protection of property value and or it mean that it was generally organized in the land. A couple examples of which public safety the location of this overlay in the downtown area is in a place where there is significant restrictions on infrastructure, there's no traffic signalization, there are no bike paths, there are limited site lines for vehicular traffic in that area and it really does not contain the supporting and feeder infrastructure of roadways, it's on the curve of Beaver Avenue into College Avenue, Calder Alley is a feeder to it and then the only one probably supporting it is East College Avenue as you travel west into town. The protection of property value, I think if you went through the downtown, there are a lot of properties that have the same intended purpose of this overlay district that would be impacted negatively by more supply. On the other hand, there are residential areas on that side of town that would say, they are going to negatively impact my neighborhood by the density it creates and the utilization in that area. That coupled with the fact that its such a small geographic area, basically a one block area, in the downtown, said to me its generally organized but awful small if there’s an intended use for a greater community good out of the land area.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Second, as I went further in and going back to equations, and variables, variables have definitions and equations have definitions and what the ordinance lacked in my opinion was definition on any number of terms. One of the examples I gave was graduate student or professional. I don't know what that means- Is it graduate student full time? Is it graduate student part time? Online, professional? Is there an income level? How do we define those types of terms. They may be understood generally but at least the ordinance didn't specifically define what they were there for and being able to be measured against as to whether or not they met that ordinance. I'll contribute a little bit on the ordinance, it creates an undocumented occupancy process where owners are defined broadly as owning a unit. Perfect example would be, mother and father buy unit with daughter and daughter allows three unrelated relatives to live there. Is that an owner occupied unit or an undergraduate student unit? There is a potential for conflict. It lacked some measurable restrictions, the example I gave was it allowed for pedestrian access on the first floor in the retail area but didn't say how much could be pedestrian access and went so far as to show by example if I have an ATM on the first floor, that's a commercial use and an allowable use and is the rest available for pedestrian access and common space? Are we really trying to promote first floor commercial use? And if we are, we should prompt that with a restriction of what the minimum required to be at that level.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One of the sections that I think I held in a lowest opinion was things that say whether or not a wall is 50 feet long and its desirable or not. I think those are subjective ordinances, not objective or quantitative ordinances where you can measure. You can certainly measure 50 feet and a one foot setback but to whose eyes is that desirable or undesirable? A statement like that would be more of an architectural review board than it would be in a land use ordinance in something that we were presented here. Parking, had to do with the distance of how far it would be from the site, within 400 feet of the property within 400 feet of that general area, there is no utilization for larger parking areas so by allowing it is great, but the actualization of it being used is more important. If you can get it within 400 feet, fantastic, if you can't, it should be left out of the ordinance and not a measurable statistic to achieve a variance from, or an increase from. Fees for offsite parking, all fantastic, it's great to have more dense parking, the unfortunate part is that it didn't give a restriction for how far away that could be. Building a parking garage on the west end of town with the money from the east end of town doesn't serve the purpose between the two. Generally speaking those fees have to be applied to a more restricted area. And then lastly, on that, the parking was noted as public parking was being defined as a more efficient manner. What's more efficient and how is it measured? Going right back to all these equations and variables, what do they equal when you sum them together.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the biggest thing I want to say about this is I was critical the whole way through the process but I think that is what we were asked to do. We were asked to look at it with a critical eye and determine one way or the other. I could've easily gone to the other side of this provided a few more definitions and clarifications on what were intended here. I believe in zoning, I think zoning is a good thing, I think we all do, it serves a good of the community that I believe to be defined as it creates safety, it doesn't put hazardous waste incinerators in the backyards of a residential neighborhoods, it&nbsp;doesn't create density where it's not supported by infrastructure. It helps to protect property values and those were a few of the things that I mentioned in the beginning. I don't think this ordinance creates any of that in that regard, it was more of a very subjective right on what we would like to see there.&nbsp;The owners of that land have certain inherent rights that they own by title for that land. Going back to King George that's how titles got passed and deeds became titles to land, that title or that deed gives that owner the inherent right to use that land as they see fit and the way that they see desirable. The specific uses of this is defined by zoning determine by whether they want to purchase that land and if they do, those rights are there. Going on subject of matter is more related as to historical review board and things of that nature that don't apply to zoning and I felt the read of this was slanted heavily in that direction of an ability to use incentive to get more versus the inherent right that comes with the property that was deeded by title to the owners. I closed with a statement from Thomas Jefferson that just says "The true foundation of a republican government (and that's not democrat/republican, that's just a republican government) it is an equal right of every citizen and his person and property and their management." It's the statement of one of our founding fathers and it's interesting to think that zoning and extrapolation of property in their management was in the founding fathers statements of what we do, so we believe in it but we also believe in the right that comes with it.&nbsp;</p>
